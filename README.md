# Bucket List Team Project- Front End/ Read.me
Overview
This is a group project assignment that was given by General Assembly.Our assignment included creating a website that pertains to bucketlists. We initally thought it would be best to mostly base it on one to many relationships. We needed to create a Single Page Application for the web that would allow a user to to interact with the website and the back end was used to authenticate the functions off CRUD.

# My user stories for this project were:

As a user I can sign up, sign in,I can change password and sign out of the app.
Once signed in, I can create a bucket list, search for bucket list items, delete a bucket list item and update a bucketlist item.
I can see if I was successful or not.

# Project Requirements are:
Our app has been deployed on Github pages.
Many cohesive commits dating back to the first day of building our project.
This read.me was created to document the process and technologies used
jquery was used for DOM manipulation and AJAX for interacting with the API

# Technologies Used:
* HTML5 Alex-Kimber-River
* CSS3-Alex
* SASS-Alex
* Bootstrap- Alex-Kimber
* JavaScript-River-Kimber-Terry-Alex
* jQuery-River-Terry

We used HTML5 to build the basic structure of the app and CSS3, SASS and Bootstrap to style.

The forms and modals were done using HTML and Bootstrap.

Javascript is used to build the logic, send AJAX calls and jQuery is used to interact with the DOM and update the view

# Stretch Goals
* To add locations to our project.
* To add social features to site that allows you to follow other users
* To allow users to make certain items public but to default to private.

# Team Participation
As a team we decided to start with meeting project requirements.
Together we joined in on discussing how our project would be created. We started by Terry whiteboarding. He made an ERD and wireframe.

Alex worked on design mostly with bootstrap,html,CSS and SASS. Alex worked on connecting the Update on the back end. He implemented images to show on our site. He used handlebars to implement a template that he chose to work with on the project. Alex and Kimber worked on implementing a modal to show when an error is made

River worked on Schema,used HTML to Sign up with email,password and password confirmation,HTML to code and revising Auth code in html.River worked on the front end Update form.

Terry created wireframe doc,created ERD doc, Terry took resposibility for merging pullrequests and backend api. Added HTML code for log out while logged in. Terry copied the auth code into the repo. He tested our API with postman. Terry is also working on maps.Terry worked on making sure you must be logged in to get bucket list items.

Kimber worked on Read.me,User stories as well as adding front end api. Created button for bucketlist in HTML.Added the crud api code from River with a few updates to fit our project needs such as updating method GET and get item by id. Added html code for changing password with current and new password.She assisted Alex with creating a modal to pop up and notify when an error is made.

We all have commits in both repos- We also each contributed to the blocks of code for route controllers in API.

# Challenges

We had a few challenges with merge conflicts.
A few minor oops on pushing to the master branch, but was resolved.
We all had our own visions on how dynamic the project was going to be.
We had to regroup and make sure we were on target to make MVP.
We had to prioritize.

#Things we did right

We had a stand up at the beginning of each day.
We communicated throughout the day.
We sat in the same space together and worked indepedantly but as a group also.
We pushed after each feature or piece of code we were responsible for.
We mostly pulled at the same time from our develpment branch so we could make sure to stay on the same page.
